# ASP.NET-Core-Web-API-&-MVC-Employee-Management-System

I have used Web-API as backend and another client app as Frontend (Both are in .net-8). i have used EF and Dapper ORM for DB operations. Along with i have used the Repository Pattern, jQuery with AJAX for CRUD operations and integrates a real API for product listings.
